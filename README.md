# Project: Create a Token

The purpose of this project is to give you an idea of and an understanding of how to create and burn a token and how it also works. This code will help you understand how the codes will be written to burn and transact a token.
## Description
Token.sol is a token that has a contract that demonstrates how to transact/mint, and burn tokens. For example, if you have 2000 tokens, you can burn half of your tokens and they will become 1000, and you cannot burn them again if the token you burn is higher than the 1000 tokens that you have and has not changed if you burn them that way. The bottom line here is that you can produce, transfer, and track tokens being processed on this project.


## Getting Started
Now, what are the requirements for this to work? The first is an Ethereum environment. The Ethereum environment that we will be using is Remix-Ethreuem IDE, which can be used on our desktops or web browsers.
### Installing

* In order to utilize Ethereum and whatever else you want as long as it supports Ethereum, such as some IDEs like Metamask, Remix, Geth, and so on, we'll need to set up a specific environment.
You must open the Token.sol file and execute it on the IDE you have selected after you have decided on it.
* You must first open the Token.sol file and execute it on the IDE of your choice after deciding on it.
### Executing program

* If you don't yet have the auto compiler set, you may first click the Solidity Compiler icon on the left side of the screen to execute the program in the Remix-Ethereum IDE.
* After that, we move on to the Deploy and Run transaction icon underneath Solidity Compiler so you may engage with the mint and burn function as much as you like.
*  You will see two functions which is Â the "mint" and the "burn". The mint function will add your tokens to your address, while the burn function will deduct your tokens from your address depending on the amount of tokens you will burn.
